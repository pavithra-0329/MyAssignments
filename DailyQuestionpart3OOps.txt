1.What is oops stands for?

OOPS - Object Oriented Programming Language

2.What is Polymorphism? explain types?
 Polymorphism which means that single action can be performed  in multiple form of implementation.
 there are 2 types,
i.  Method Overloading
ii. Method Overriding
method overloading - it is a same class  and same method but different arguments.
method overriding -  it is a  different  class with same method name.

3.what is interface and example in selenium,java?
Interface is a design and its unimplemented method and  it's a blueprint of a class .
It's has static constantss and abstract methods.
it is used to achive abstraction.
   i .example of selenium , (chrome driver -extends-remotewebdriver)
   ii.example of java,  ( samsung -extends-samgsungphone)(samsungphone -extends- ipone)

4.what is abstarct class and example?
A class wich is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class. 
 It is partially implemented and unimplemented method.
its a restricted class that cannot used to create objects ,it must inherited from another.
example:
selenium:driver.findelemet(By)

5.Difference between multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance
          MULTIPLE INHERITANCE                                  MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE
 i .Multiple inheritance is inherits from more             Multilevel inheritance inherits from derived base class for new class.
    than one base class.
 ii. its is not widely used because its makes the          it is widely used.
   system more complex.
iii.it has two class namely base and derived class.      it has three level class namely,base class,intermediate,derived class.
ex, parent- child1-child2....                                            ex, grandparent-parent-child.

6.Is multiple inheritance possible in java?
No,multiple inheritance not possible in java.

7.What is keyword for using inheritance 
"Extends" keyword is using for inheritance. 

8.what is the keyword to connect interface and class
"implements " is the keyword used for connect interface and class.

9.what is difference between class and interface
		Class				Interface
i. Class  is a group of object which have common                       Interface is a design. 
properties.                 
ii.class is a implemented method.                                             interface is a unimplemented method.
iii. class can be possible to create object.                                it cannot be create object.

10.what is difference between class and abstract class
		Class				Abstract Class
i. Class  is a group of object which have common                  a class which is declared abstract keyword known as abstract class.
properties.     
ii. class is a implemented method.                                          abstract class is partially implemented and unimplemented method.
iii. class can be possible to create object.                               its a restricted class that cannot used to create objects ,it must inherited from another.
